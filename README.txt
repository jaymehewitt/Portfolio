Jayme Hewitt's Portfolio v1.0
-----------------------------

This was a fun project to get off the ground. I wasn't initially sure if I was going to start from
scratch or use a template. Since the goal of the project was later defined as get something up quick,
I decided to go find a template to work from for v1.0. I found this template from HTML5UP.net and loved
the paralax movement of the large background image. I immediately set about customizing this and that.
I changed fonts, sections, and added a nav bar.

V2.0 goals:
I would love to have two separate areas of my portfolio: one for product management work and one
for website development work. I will start by adding separate pages for each of my product management
projects to help explain the process and outcome of each of my projects.

It will also be a priority to start getting the individual pieces linked up: blog post, HTML email, etc.
